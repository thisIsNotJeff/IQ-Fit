## Tutor Comment
Great job! You've made a game that is functional and intuitive for first-time players.

You've made good use of commit in regards to commiting your work regularly and using it to help manage your teamwork. However, the commit messages could include more detail about what they have achieved/fixed. Forexample, you might include that a bug has been fixed, or that a task has been completed, but still has some persisting bugs. This makes it easier if you need to check what your teammates have done, or if you need to rollback to an earlier version.

Your presentation.pdf had some appropriately chosen screenshots, however we wanted to also see a summary of your game, and more detail about your design approach.

Your comments above methods are really good when you include them, but unfortunately not all of your methods have comments.

Your code style is good for the most part, with well chosen method and variable names. However, there are some large sections of duplicate code that would be better to have in methods.

It would be great to see more tests for your testable (non GUI) methods, you made a good start with the ones that you had.

Your game works well from the user's point of view, however there are some non-fatal errors that occur while playing the game, for example when you hold the backslash to get a hint.

Overall you've done a great job, including being able to implement a recursive method to find hints, well done!
