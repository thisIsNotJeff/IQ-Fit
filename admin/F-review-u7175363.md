Reviewing code written by: <Qinrui Cheng> <u7133046>

Component: [Viewer.java] (https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7133046/comp1110-ass2-tue15g/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/ass2/gui/Viewer.java#L30-117) the simple viewer from the task #4.

### Comments 

1. With this simple viewer, we can visualize the string placement easily. 
This is really helpful when I write task6, it helped me debug without wasting time one drawing the game on paper.

2. However, I found there aren't many comments in the code, it's easy to lose their orientations when someone is reading a bunch of code without documentations.

3. The structure in the Viewer is pretty clear, he used a For Loop to construct the main body of the code.
He handled different directions in the placement string by rotating
